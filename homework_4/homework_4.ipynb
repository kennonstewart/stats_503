Using `scipy.stats.norm.pdf` to compute the necessary probability density functions, show both of the estimated class-conditional densities in the same plot. Also show the estimated Bayes decision boundary in this plot. Make sure to label the axes. Let $c$ denote the position of the decision boundary. Report the numerical value of $c$."
